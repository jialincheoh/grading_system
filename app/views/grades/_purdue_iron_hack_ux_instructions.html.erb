<h3> Purdue IronHack UX Grading Instructions </h3>
<div>
  <strong>User Scenario / Problem Statement:</strong>
  <p>
    We’re all savvy consumers and need to know when to get the cheapest vegetables and produce from local vendors.
    With the ever changing weather we need to know when we can get the best and cheapest produce throughout the seasons.
    Imagine you are trying to figure out when and where you can get the cheapest and best local produce from local markets
    in West Lafayette/Lafayette and in the Greater Lafayette Area.
  </p>

  <strong>Task:</strong>
  <p>
    Develop a website with a mashup that combines Climate Data Online (http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/climate-data-online-cdo),
    local farmer’s markets data along with weather and seasonal data. You are also encouraged to look at other types of market
    data such as Walmart, Pay-Less, Aldi, Meijer, etc. to compare regular prices or somehow combine freshness
    and cheapness – think what would be beneficial to the consumer! The website should optimize the consumers’ choice of the most
    cost-efficient vegetables by giving them a number of alternatives. Examples of features: ‘freshness scale’, price,
    list of vendors, integration with Google Maps/Open Maps, distance, comparison of prices etc.
  </p>

  <p> 0 = NO ISSUE: I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all (its fine as is) </p>
  <p> 1 = COSMETIC PROBLEM ONLY: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project </p>
  <p> 2 = USABILITY PROBLEM: This problem (functional or design) should be fixed </p>
  <p> 3 = USABILITY CATASTROPHE: Imperative to FIX this before product can be released </p>
